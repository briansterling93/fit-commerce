## Fit Commerce

E-Fit Commerce is a fitness related e-commerce store which provides visitors with the typical e-commerce experience. Users have the ability to browse items freely, or create an account and make fictional purchases. Each user has access to their own dashboard and account details, which includes order history tracking & general account information. This website is strictly for portfolio showcasing, as it is completely fictional.

This full stack application was built using React and JavaScript within the front-end, while the backend configuring consists of MySQL, Node, and Express. Each of the user's data is stored within the MySQL Database once an account is created, keeping track of each user's order history, shopping cart, account details, etc, within the different mySQL tables. Additionally, this information within the mySQL tables is obtained and produced within the User Interface with the use of axios & asyncronous development.
